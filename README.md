# WelcomeMessages v1.3.4
![Screenshot](images/screenshot.png)


A clean, lightweight welcome plugin for Minecraft servers that actually works. No bloat, no premium features locked behind paywalls, just good old-fashioned join/quit messages done right. Now with 12 amazing text animations, enhanced security, and perfect compatibility!

## Why Another Welcome Plugin?

Look, I needed a welcome plugin that wasn't from 2018, didn't break every update, and didn't try to do 500 things at once. Most welcome plugins are either abandoned, premium for basic features, or so bloated they cause lag. This one just works.

- **Config Validation** - Won't crash your server with bad settings
- **PlaceholderAPI Support** - Use data in other plugins and chat

## Screenshots

Well, it's a chat plugin... here's what messages look like:
```
[+] Welcome FiveDollaGobby to the server! (#42nd player)
[+] [VIP] SomeVIP joined the game
[-] Player123 left the game
```

But honestly, you'll customize these anyway.

## Installation

1. Download the jar
2. Put it in /plugins
3. Restart server
4. Edit configs if you want
5. You're done

Requires Paper/Spigot 1.21.x (all versions from 1.21 to 1.21.9) and Java 21 (because Minecraft requires it, not me). Works on both Spigot and Paper with enhanced compatibility.

## Config

Two files, both human-readable:

**config.yml** - Features on/off, performance stuff
**messages.yml** - All your messages (with examples)

Placeholders that work:
- `{player}` - The player's name (obviously)
- `{displayname}` - Player's display name
- `{world}` - Current world
- `{online}` - Online count
- `{max}` - Max players
- `{joincount}` - How many times they've joined
- `{time}` - Morning/afternoon/evening
- `{ordinal}` - First join position (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.)
- More in the config comments

## PlaceholderAPI Support

If you have PlaceholderAPI installed, you can use these placeholders in other plugins:

**Player Data:**
- `%welcome_joincount%` - How many times the player has joined
- `%welcome_firstjoin%` - true/false if it's their first join
- `%welcome_messagesdisabled%` - true/false if they disabled messages
- `%welcome_lastseen%` - When they were last seen (formatted)
- `%welcome_firstjointime%` - When they first joined (formatted)
- `%welcome_time_since_last_seen%` - How long since last seen
- `%welcome_time_since_first_join%` - How long since first join

**Server Data:**
- `%welcome_total_unique_joins%` - Total unique players who joined
- `%welcome_join_ordinal%` - Server's join count as ordinal
- `%welcome_time_greeting%` - Morning/afternoon/evening
- `%welcome_server_uptime%` - How long server has been running

**Status:**
- `%welcome_status%` - Player status (New Player, Regular Player, etc.)
- `%welcome_rank%` - Player's rank (VIP, MVP, ADMIN, OWNER, DEFAULT)

## üèÜ Custom Rank System

Define unlimited custom ranks in your `config.yml`:

```yaml
custom-ranks:
  enabled: true
  ranks:
    - "founder"     # Highest rank
    - "coowner"     # Second highest
    - "manager"     # Third highest
    - "moderator"   # Fourth highest
    - "helper"      # Fifth highest
    - "vip"         # Sixth highest
    - "member"      # Lowest rank
```

**Perfect for:**
- Multiple VIP tiers (VIP1, VIP2, VIP3, VIP4)
- Custom server ranks (Builder, Helper, Moderator, etc.)
- Any rank structure you want

**How it works:**
1. Define ranks in `config.yml` (in priority order)
2. Add messages for each rank in `messages.yml`
3. Give players `welcome.rank.<rankname>` permissions
4. Plugin automatically detects and uses the highest rank

**Example - Multiple VIP Tiers:**
```yaml
ranks:
  - "owner"
  - "admin"
  - "vip4"      # Highest VIP
  - "vip3"      # Second VIP
  - "vip2"      # Third VIP
  - "vip1"      # Lowest VIP
  - "member"
```

Stuff I might add if people actually use this:
- [ ] MySQL support (but why?)
- [ ] Discord webhooks (maybe)
- [ ] Custom sounds (when I figure out resource packs)

- [X] Config validation (done!)
