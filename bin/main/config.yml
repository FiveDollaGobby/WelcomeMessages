# Example: If you have VIP1, VIP2, VIP3, VIP4 ranks, add them here in priority order

  enabled: true
  # List your custom ranks in priority order (highest priority first)
  # The plugin will use the first rank the player has permission for
  ranks:
    - "owner"      # Server owner
    - "admin"      # Administrator  
    - "moderator"  # Moderator
    - "mvp"        # MVP rank

    - "premium"    # Premium rank
    - "donator"    # Donator rank

  # Example for multiple VIP tiers:
